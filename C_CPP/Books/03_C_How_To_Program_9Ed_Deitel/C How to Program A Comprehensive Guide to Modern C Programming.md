## Prefacio Contextual

The relevance of *C How to Program, Ninth Edition* emerges from the enduring significance of C in high-performance computing amidst rapid technological evolution. Originating in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, C remains a cornerstone for operating systems, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications due to its efficiency and control over hardware resources. In the 2020s, as computing paradigms shift toward cloud-based solutions, IoT proliferation, and AI-driven innovation, the need for skilled C programmers has surged. This book fills a critical gap by updating traditional C instruction with modern contexts—addressing security vulnerabilities, leveraging multicore architectures, and integrating data science principles as recommended by ACM/IEEE curricula. Dedicated to Ritchie, it honors his legacy while preparing readers for cutting-edge challenges in software engineering.
