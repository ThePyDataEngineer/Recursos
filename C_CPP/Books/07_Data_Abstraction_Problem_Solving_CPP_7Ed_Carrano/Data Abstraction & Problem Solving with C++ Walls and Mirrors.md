# Data Abstraction & Problem Solving with C++: Walls and Mirrors
## A Structured Approach to Algorithmic Thinking and Software Design

---

## Resumen General (Abstract)

*Data Abstraction & Problem Solving with C++: Walls and Mirrors, Seventh Edition*, authored by Frank M. Carrano and Timothy M. Henry, is a seminal text that provides a comprehensive exploration of data abstraction, object-oriented programming, and problem-solving techniques using C++. Spanning 21 chapters and enriched with C++ Interludes, this edition integrates the C++11 standard to address modern software development needs in fields such as systems programming, simulations, and algorithmic design. The book employs a dual analogy—walls for data abstraction and mirrors for recursion—to structure its pedagogy, offering over 200 complete examples and exercises that emphasize safe, secure coding practices. It balances foundational topics like arrays and linked lists with advanced concepts such as balanced search trees and graphs, supported by a clear separation of abstract data type (ADT) specification and implementation. Key contributions include its progressive introduction of linked data via simple ADTs (e.g., bags, stacks), extensive use of the Standard Template Library (STL), and practical applications like external storage processing. This work equips readers with the tools to design efficient, modular software, making it an essential resource for mastering C++ in an era of evolving computational complexity.

## Prefacio Contextual

The relevance of *Data Abstraction & Problem Solving with C++* stems from C++’s enduring role as a cornerstone language in computer science since its development by Bjarne Stroustrup in the 1980s. As software demands escalate in areas like artificial intelligence, real-time systems, and large-scale data processing, C++ remains critical for its performance and flexibility. The introduction of C++11 modernized the language with features like templates and exceptions, necessitating updated educational resources aligned with current standards and ACM/IEEE curricula. This seventh edition fills this gap by reimagining traditional data structures pedagogy, incorporating secure coding practices, and leveraging contemporary tools. Building on the legacy of Helman and Veroff’s original "Walls and Mirrors" framework, Carrano and Henry refine this approach to meet 21st-century challenges, offering a bridge between theoretical foundations and practical software engineering. Its dedication to accessible yet rigorous instruction positions it as a vital text amidst rapid technological advancement.

## Audiencia Objetivo

This book is tailored for:

- **Undergraduate Students**: Enrolled in introductory or intermediate computer science courses (CS1/CS2), with basic programming knowledge (e.g., variables, loops).
- **Educators**: Seeking a pedagogically sound text with modular content and practical examples for teaching C++ and data structures.
- **Professional Programmers**: Transitioning to C++ for performance-critical applications, with prior experience in another language (e.g., Java, Python).

## Estructura y Organización

The book’s 21 chapters, seven C++ Interludes, and appendices form a progressive framework that separates ADT specification from implementation, enhancing conceptual clarity and flexibility. Chapters 1-5 establish core concepts—data abstraction, recursion, and basic implementations (arrays, linked lists)—using the ADT bag as an accessible entry point. Chapters 6-14 explore fundamental ADTs (stacks, lists, queues) with practical applications, while Chapters 15-21 tackle advanced structures (trees, graphs, external storage). Interludes introduce C++ features (e.g., classes, exceptions) as needed, ensuring technical fluency without overwhelming the reader. This sequence builds from simple to complex, reinforcing abstraction and problem-solving at each stage. The modular design allows instructors to adapt the order—covering specifications first or integrating implementations—supporting a scaffolded mastery of C++ and data structures tailored to diverse learning goals.

# Capítulos

## Capítulo 1: Data Abstraction: The Walls

### Resumen Ejecutivo
Chapter 1 introduces object-oriented concepts and the specification of abstract data types (ADTs), using the ADT bag as a foundational example. It explores software engineering principles like cohesion and coupling, emphasizing data abstraction as a "wall" that isolates implementation details. The chapter specifies the bag’s operations via a C++ template interface, providing practical examples of its use. It sets a methodological tone by integrating UML and secure coding practices, preparing readers for structured software design.
