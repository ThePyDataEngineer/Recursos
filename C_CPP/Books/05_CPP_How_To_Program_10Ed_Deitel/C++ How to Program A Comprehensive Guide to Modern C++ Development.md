## Mastering Object-Oriented and Systems Programming in the 21st Century

---

## Resumen General (Abstract)

*C++ How to Program, Tenth Edition*, authored by Paul Deitel and Harvey Deitel, is an authoritative resource designed to equip readers with a thorough understanding of C++ programming in the context of contemporary software development. Spanning over 1,000 pages, this global edition integrates the C++11 and C++14 standards, addressing the demand for robust, high-performance applications in fields such as artificial intelligence, big data, and systems programming. The book employs a signature live-code approach, featuring hundreds of complete, working programs with sample executions, eschewing fragmented code snippets for practical, hands-on learning. It balances foundational concepts—variables, control structures, and functions—with advanced topics like object-oriented programming (OOP), templates, and Standard Library containers. Key contributions include its emphasis on secure coding practices, extensive use of modern compilers (GNU C++, Visual Studio, Xcode), and real-world case studies that bridge theory and application. This edition stands as a vital tool for mastering C++ amidst evolving technological paradigms, offering both novices and seasoned developers a pathway to proficiency in one of computing’s most enduring languages.

## Prefacio Contextual

The significance of *C++ How to Program, Tenth Edition* lies in C++’s persistent relevance since its inception by Bjarne Stroustrup in the 1980s. As a language that underpins operating systems, embedded systems, and performance-critical software, C++ remains indispensable in an era dominated by cloud computing, IoT, and AI-driven solutions. The release of C++11 and C++14 standards reflects the language’s evolution, incorporating features like smart pointers and lambda expressions to meet modern demands. This book addresses a critical need: updating traditional C++ pedagogy to align with these standards and the ACM/IEEE computing curricula. Dedicated to Marvin Minsky, a pioneer in artificial intelligence, it bridges historical foundations with cutting-edge applications, preparing readers to tackle complex programming challenges in a rapidly advancing field.
